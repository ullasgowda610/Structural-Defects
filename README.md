# Structural-Defects

Structural Defects is an AI-powered application designed to identify, analyse, and generate reports on structural issues from uploaded images.

Users can upload an image of a structure, and the model analyses it to detect potential defects.

Once the analysis is complete, a detailed report is generated, which can be shared with the relevant authorities for timely and appropriate action.

The system leverages Google Generative AI, Streamlit, and Prompt Engineering techniques to ensure accurate detection and reporting.

Currently, the application is running successfully on a local VS Code server. However, deployment on Streamlit Cloud is under progress, as certain compatibility issues are being addressed.
